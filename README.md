# Awesome-Industrial-Vision-Datasets

A curated collection of publicly available visual datasets focused on industrial inspection. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of datasets used in computer vision tasks for industrial applications, such as defect detection, quality control, and manufacturing monitoring. Datasets are summarized in a tabular format for easy comparison and access.

We include key properties for each dataset to help researchers and practitioners quickly evaluate suitability. Note: This is a work-in-progress list with placeholder data. Contributions are welcome to add real datasets!

## Datasets

The following table lists datasets with essential details. For quick navigation:
- Sort by columns in your Markdown viewer or convert to HTML for interactive tables.
- Links are provided where available (placeholders for now).
- Use the search function in your browser to filter by domain or year.

### Key Explanations
- **Dataset Scale**: Approximate number of images/samples and categories.
- **Dataset Domain**: Primary industrial application area.
- **License**: Usage permissions (e.g., for research/commercial).
- **Availability**: Public, restricted, or private.
- **Annotation**: Type of labels provided (e.g., pixel-level, bounding boxes).
- **Dataset Link**: Direct download or access URL.
- **Provider**: Organization or authors responsible.
- **Source**: Whether data is from real-world captures or simulations.
- **Dataset Quality**: Subjective assessment based on diversity, balance, and realism (High/Medium/Low).
- **Proposed Year**: Year of initial release or publication.
- **Citation (BibTeX)**: Ready-to-use BibTeX for referencing.

## Utilities
This section can include tools or scripts for dataset handling (e.g., download scripts, preprocessing code). Currently placeholders:
- `download_datasets.py`: A Python script to batch-download datasets from links.
- `visualize_anomalies.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for quick visualization of samples.
